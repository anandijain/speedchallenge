-------

plan:
	* first need to build io.
		-read files into arrays for the neural network
	* build a 'dataloader' to get x,y tuples (image, speed)
	* build various nn models and test
	* possibly try a pretrained model


wants:
	* full runs on gpu
	
-------
Would like to attempt doing it in Julia.

Start with basic MLP.

RNN probably a good idea.

Neural ODE probably too computationally intensive (haven't figured out my CUDNN install problems)

I usually use Pytorch, but I might want to try Tensorflow. Starting with pytorch tho
